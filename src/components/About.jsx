          For years, I thought I wasn't cut out for software engineering. I never viewed myself as a "tech-y" kind of guy, or I
          thought I was too right-brained to work in tech. Enter JavaScript and its creative awesomeness. A relative of mine
          showed me just how creative the world of web development is, and the minute I saw my code changes pop up
          in the browser in real time I was hooked. From humble p-tags to bigger-and-badder React apps, I am constantly learning more
          and more about the tools that allow me to put whatever I can think up onto the web for everyone to use!
