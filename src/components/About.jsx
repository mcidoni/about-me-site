          Hey there, I'm Matt! Thanks for checking out my site, I built it myself! As a web developer, I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to bring peoples' ideas (and my own) to life on the web! I have always been drawn to just about anything creative, and I always enjoy sharing my creativity with others! My journey in web development has been exciting so far, and I am always looking to grow and use my skills to help others. From humble p-tags to bigger-and-badder React apps, I am constantly learning more
          and more about the tools that allow me to put whatever I can think up onto the web for everyone to use!
